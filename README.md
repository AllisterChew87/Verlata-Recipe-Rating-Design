# Recipe Rating Api - Design Document

## Summary
- All POST operations such as creating a new recipe, submitting a rating, or adding a comment will be stored in MSSQL for relational data integrity.
- New recipes are currently stored without associating them with a user ID.
- New recipes and ratings are also indexed in elastic search to support full-text, fuzzy and filtered search capabilities.
- The ratings endpoint retrieves the previous recipe rating (if any) and recalculates the recipe's average rating accordingly. Individual user ratings are currently not factored in, as the focus is on maintaining an average rating for the recipe.
- The comment endpoint stores the user id to associate each comment with its recipe, allowing the application to display who posted the comment on the recipe.
